- Fixed spellbook spells not being placed
- Fixed certain spells not being placed if an overriding version is present (e.g. Druid ability "Swipe", Rogue ability "Gloomblade")
- Added a small delay for the TOYS_UPDATED event to ensure placing toys only happens after the toybox API is available
- Added support for 5 bonus bars available only to certain classes and player states (druid forms, dragonriding, stealth)
