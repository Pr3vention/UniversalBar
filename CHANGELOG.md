- Updated TOC for Midnight prepatch 12.0.0
- Added support for single-button assist
- Fixed bug with macros that use /cast and #showtooltip not correctly saving. NOTE- If you change the name of the macro, you will have to save your UniversalBar settings again. There currently isn't a way to detect which macro(s) change when the UPDATE_MACROS event fires.
